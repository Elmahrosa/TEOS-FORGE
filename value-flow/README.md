# Value Flow Module

The **Value Flow** module defines how economic value moves through TEOS Forge
in a way that is **accountable, auditable, and governance-first**.

Value flow is not automatic.
It is **earned through verified contribution** and **gated by audit and governance**.

This module exists to prevent speculation, favoritism, and opaque payouts.

---

## Purpose

The Value Flow module exists to:

- Reward verified contribution
- Protect treasury integrity
- Enforce governance over payouts
- Align incentives with long-term participation
- Preserve institutional trust

---

## Scope

This module governs:

- Reward eligibility
- Treasury approval and disbursement
- Staking and reputation mechanics
- Slashing and penalties
- Payout pauses during disputes or audits

---

## Core Principles

1. No verification → no value  
2. No audit clearance → no payout  
3. No governance trace → no treasury action  
4. Disputes pause value flow  
5. Reputation outweighs speed  

---

## Dependencies

- **People** → identifies eligible recipients
- **Contribution** → produces verified events
- **Audit** → clears or blocks payouts
- **Accountability** → enforces holds and escalation

Value Flow is the final execution layer, never the first.
