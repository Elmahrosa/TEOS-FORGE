# Tokenomics & Reward Rules

This document defines **how rewards are calculated and distributed**
within TEOS Forge.

Tokenomics are designed to **incentivize contribution**, not speculation.

---

## Reward Eligibility

A contributor is eligible for rewards only if:

- Contribution is verified
- CI checks passed
- Required reviews completed
- Audit clearance granted
- No active disputes or escalations

Eligibility is revoked immediately upon audit failure.

---

## Reward Types

TEOS Forge supports multiple reward classes:

- **Non-monetary**
  - Badges
  - Reputation points
  - Role eligibility

- **Monetary (optional)**
  - Token rewards
  - Royalties
  - Staking yield

Not all verified contributions result in monetary rewards.

## Reward Calculation (Conceptual)

Rewards may consider:

- Contribution type (code, docs, audit, governance)
- Impact level
- Review depth
- Long-term value
- Reputation score

Exact formulas are governed and adjustable by proposal.

---

## Anti-Speculation Rules

- No retroactive rewards
- No rewards without verification
- No rewards during disputes
- No self-approved payouts

Tokenomics must remain auditable and explainable.
