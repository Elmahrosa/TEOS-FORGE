# Treasury Governance

This document defines **how the TEOS Forge treasury is governed**
and how payouts are approved and executed.

The treasury is a shared public resource, not a discretionary fund.

---

## Treasury Principles

- Transparency over speed
- Governance over discretion
- Audit over authority
- Preservation over growth

---

## Payout Requirements

A payout may occur only if:

- Contribution is verified
- Audit clearance exists
- No active dispute or escalation
- Governance approval is recorded (if required)
- Payout intent is logged

Any missing condition invalidates the payout.

---

## Approval Roles

| Role | Authority |
|----|-----------|
| Contributor | No payout authority |
| Maintainer | Initiates payout request |
| Steward | Reviews governance compliance |
| Auditor | Grants or blocks clearance |

No single role can execute a payout unilaterally.

---

## Payout Holds

Payouts are automatically paused when:

- Audit finding is open
- Governance dispute is active
- Security issue is unresolved
- Abuse or misuse is suspected

Holds remain until formally resolved and logged.

---

## Transparency

All treasury actions must be:

- Logged
- Reviewable
- Traceable to governance decisions
- Reversible if misapplied

Treasury opacity is a governance failure.
