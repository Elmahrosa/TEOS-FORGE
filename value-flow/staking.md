# Staking, Reputation & Slashing

This document defines how **staking and reputation**
are used to align long-term behavior in TEOS Forge.

Staking represents commitment, not speculation.

---

## Reputation System

Reputation is earned through:

- Verified contributions
- Consistent participation
- Governance involvement
- Audit cooperation

Reputation affects:
- Role eligibility
- Reward weighting
- Governance trust

---

## Staking Principles

- Staking is optional
- Staking does not override governance
- Staked value may amplify responsibility
- Higher stake = higher accountability

---

## Slashing Conditions

Slashing may occur when:

- Governance rules are violated
- Audit findings confirm abuse
- Authority is misused
- Repeated bad-faith behavior is proven

Slashing must:
- Be proportional
- Be documented
- Follow audit confirmation
- Allow appeal via governance process

---

## Slashing Process

1. Finding logged by Auditor
2. Evidence reviewed
3. Governance decision recorded
4. Slashing executed (if approved)
5. Action logged permanently

No automated slashing without human review.

---

## Final Rule

Staking increases responsibility, not immunity.

Reputation is harder to earn than tokens,
and easier to lose than regain.
