Defines identity, roles, and verification.

## Examples

Sample contributor and role configurations are available in:

- `people/examples/contributor-basic.json`
- `people/examples/contributor-verified.json`
- `people/examples/steward.json`
- `people/examples/maintainer.md`
- `people/examples/auditor.md`

These files demonstrate how identity, roles, and verification
are represented in TEOS Forge.
