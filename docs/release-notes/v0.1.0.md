# TEOS Forge v0.1.0 — Governance Release

## Highlights
- Initial governance constitution (`docs/governance.md`)
- Sustainability model (`docs/monetization.md`)
- Badge definitions (`docs/badges.md`)
- Core module scaffolds (People, Contribution, Accountability, Audit, Value Flow)
- CI pipeline with linting + policy checks
- Issue & PR templates enforcing civic-first rules

## Governance Impact
- All contributions must follow Issue → PR → CI → Review → Audit flow
- Audit findings now mapped to CI failures
- Treasury actions blocked on audit flags

## Next Roadmap
- v0.2.0 → GitHub App integration
- v0.3.0 → Value Flow staking + treasury reports
- v0.4.0 → On-chain mapping (Solana/Ethereum/Pi demo)
