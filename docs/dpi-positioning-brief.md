# TEOS Forge  
## A Governance Standard for Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)

### Executive Summary

TEOS Forge is an **Egyptian-originated, globally applicable governance standard**
for building, maintaining, and auditing **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**.

It provides a structured, auditable approach to coordinating contributors,
governance actors, and institutions around long-lived public digital systems.

TEOS Forge is not a software product.
It is a **governance and coordination framework** designed to support
institutional trust, sovereignty, and long-term sustainability.

## The Problem

Digital Public Infrastructure increasingly depends on open-source software,
yet many public systems face recurring challenges:

- Informal or undocumented governance
- Limited auditability of contributions and decisions
- Unclear authority and escalation paths
- Dependence on vendors or individuals
- Difficulty sustaining systems beyond project cycles

These challenges reduce institutional confidence and long-term viability.

---

## The TEOS Forge Approach

TEOS Forge addresses these challenges by defining a **governance-first model**
for public digital development.

Key characteristics:

- Explicit roles and separation of powers
- Documented decision-making and escalation
- Continuous audit readiness
- Accountable value and incentive flow (where applicable)
- Full sovereignty for adopting institutions

The framework is designed to be **adopted, forked, or federated**
without central dependency.

## Alignment with DPI Principles

TEOS Forge aligns with widely recognized DPI principles, including:

- Public accountability
- Transparency and auditability
- Interoperability and modularity
- Long-term maintainability
- Sovereign control by adopting entities

It is compatible with national, regional, and multilateral governance contexts.

## Origin and Global Applicability

TEOS Forge originated in Egypt under the leadership of
Elmahrosa International and Ayman Seif.

While Egyptian in origin, it is **jurisdiction-agnostic by design** and
intended for global adoption across diverse legal and institutional frameworks.

---

## Intended Use

TEOS Forge may be used by:

- Governments and ministries
- Public digital platforms
- Civic-tech and public software foundations
- Multilateral or regional infrastructure initiatives

It is suitable for systems expected to operate over decades,
not funding cycles.

---

## Conclusion

TEOS Forge provides a practical governance standard
for institutions seeking to build Digital Public Infrastructure
with trust, sovereignty, and durability.

It complements existing technical systems
by addressing the governance layer they often lack.
