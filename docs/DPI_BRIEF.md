# DPI Brief: The TEOS Forge Layer

**Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)** requires layers of trust that are open, transparent, and sovereign.

## The Observation Layer
In the TEOS ecosystem, the GitHub App Backend serves as the **Observation Layer**. It monitors the "Digital Forge" where public software is built.

## Key Pillars
1. **Interoperability:** Uses standard JSON/REST protocols to communicate with other TEOS modules.
2. **Transparency:** Every governance decision is backed by a permanent, human-readable audit trail.
3. **Sovereignty:** Institutions own their data, their keys, and their logs.

TEOS Forge transforms software development from a private process into a verifiable public utility.
