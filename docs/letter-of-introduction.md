# Letter of Introduction  
## TEOS Forge — Digital Public Infrastructure Governance Standard

To whom it may concern,

TEOS Forge is an Egyptian-originated, globally applicable governance framework
for the development and stewardship of **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**.

Under the leadership of Elmahrosa International and Ayman Seif,
TEOS Forge was designed to address a persistent gap in public digital systems:
the absence of explicit, auditable, and sovereign governance
for long-lived open-source infrastructure.

TEOS Forge is not a software product or vendor platform.
It is a **governance and coordination standard**
that enables institutions to build public software with:

- Clear authority and accountability
- Continuous audit readiness
- Sovereign control and exit guarantees
- Compatibility with national and multilateral frameworks

While originated in Egypt, TEOS Forge is **jurisdiction-agnostic by design**
and intended for global adoption by governments,
public institutions, and multilateral initiatives.

We invite institutions to review TEOS Forge
as a reference governance model for DPI programs
that require long-term trust, transparency, and sustainability.

Respectfully,

**Ayman Seif**  
Founder & Lead Architect  
**Elmahrosa International**
