# Introducing TEOS Forge

TEOS Forge is a **sovereign, governance-first developer coordination platform**
built on GitHub and powered by TEOS.

It turns repositories into **civic infrastructure**.

---

## Why TEOS Forge Exists

Open-source powers the world —  
but governance, accountability, and auditability are often missing.

TEOS Forge fixes that.

---

## What TEOS Forge Provides

- Verified contribution
- Explicit governance
- Audit-ready logs
- Accountable value flow
- Institutional trust without centralization

This is not a DAO experiment.
This is developer infrastructure for the public good.

---

## How It’s Different

- Governance before automation
- Audit before value
- Humans before smart contracts
- Institutions and open-source together

---

## Who It’s For

- Open-source communities
- Civic-tech builders
- Public digital infrastructure
- Governments and enterprises

---

## Status

Phase 0 (Governance Foundation): **Complete**  
Phase 1 (GitHub App): **Next**

---

TEOS Forge is open enough to earn trust,
structured enough to govern,
and sovereign enough to matter.
