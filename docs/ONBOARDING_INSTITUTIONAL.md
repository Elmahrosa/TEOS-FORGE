# Institutional Onboarding: TEOS Forge

This guide outlines the integration of TEOS Forge for global institutions and national digital agencies.

## Strategic Alignment
TEOS Forge follows the **Elmahrosa Digital Sovereignty Protocol**. It allows institutions to:
- Maintain full oversight of software supply chains.
- Define custom governance signals without vendor lock-in.
- Ensure all audit logs remain within national or institutional jurisdictions.

## Integration Steps
1. **Deployment:** Deploy the TEOS Forge Docker image on sovereign infrastructure.
2. **App Registration:** Register your instance as a GitHub App within your organization.
3. **Policy Mapping:** Define your "High-Severity" events in config.js.
4. **Audit Anchoring:** Configure the backend to anchor audit hashes to your preferred cryptographic layer.
