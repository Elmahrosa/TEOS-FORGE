## Conceptual Alignment

### Governance
DPI emphasizes clear accountability.
TEOS Forge enforces this through documented governance rules
and decision traceability.

### Audit
DPI requires transparency and oversight.
TEOS Forge embeds audit as a continuous process,
not a periodic review.

### Sovereignty
DPI systems must remain under public control.
TEOS Forge ensures adopting institutions retain
full authority and exit rights.

### Interoperability
DPI benefits from modularity.
TEOS Forge is designed to integrate with existing systems
without imposing technical lock-in.

## Language Guidance

When presenting TEOS Forge in DPI contexts:

Use:
- “Governance framework”
- “Public digital infrastructure”
- “Institutional coordination”
- “Audit readiness”

Avoid:
- “Platform lock-in”
- “Token-first”
- “Decentralized control” (without context)
- “Autonomous governance”

## Summary

TEOS Forge is aligned with DPI principles
at the governance and coordination layer.

It complements technical DPI components
by providing the institutional structure
required for long-term trust and sustainability.
