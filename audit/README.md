# Audit Module

The **Audit** module defines how TEOS Forge ensures repositories are
**reviewable, compliant, and institution-ready**.

Audit in TEOS Forge is not an afterthought.
It is a continuous process embedded in governance, CI, and contribution flow.

---

## Purpose

The Audit module exists to:

- Verify compliance with governance rules
- Enforce repository hygiene
- Produce traceable, reviewable records
- Support institutional and public-sector trust

Audit is designed to **support builders** while **protecting the system**.

---

## Scope

The Audit module governs:

- Contribution verification
- Governance enforcement
- CI and branch protection compliance
- Security and disclosure policies
- Release readiness
- Value-flow eligibility checks

Audit applies to **all repositories** under TEOS Forge.

---

## Audit Triggers

Audits are triggered when:

- Pull requests are merged into protected branches
- Governance rules are modified
- CI requirements change
- Security or compliance issues are raised
- Value-flow actions are proposed

---

## Authority

Audit authority is exercised by the **Auditor** role.

Auditors may:
- Log audit findings
- Require remediation
- Block releases pending resolution
- Recommend governance changes

Auditors may **not**:
- Merge code
- Assign roles
- Execute value-flow actions

---

## Relationship to Other Modules

- **Contribution** → provides events to verify
- **Accountability** → enforces escalation
- **People** → defines who may audit
- **Value Flow** → depends on audit clearance

Audit is the trust backbone of TEOS Forge.
