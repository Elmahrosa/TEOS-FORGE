# Accountability Module

The **Accountability** module defines how authority is exercised, challenged, and enforced
within TEOS Forge.

It ensures that decisions are:
- Traceable
- Reviewable
- Escalatable
- Enforced without centralization

This module prevents informal power accumulation
and replaces it with documented authority and process.

---

## Scope

The Accountability module governs:

- Role-based permissions
- Decision enforcement
- Dispute handling
- Escalation protocols
- Emergency intervention

It applies to **all repositories** operating under TEOS Forge governance.

---

## Authority Model

Authority is **role-based**, not individual-based.

| Role | Authority |
|----|-----------|
| Contributor | Submit work and proposals |
| Steward | Review governance and disputes |
| Maintainer | Enforce merge and CI rules |
| Auditor | Block releases and log findings |

No role has unilateral control over governance or value flow.

---

## When Accountability Is Triggered

Accountability procedures are triggered when:

- A governance rule is challenged
- A merge or release is disputed
- A security or compliance concern is raised
- Audit findings are ignored
- Value-flow actions are contested

## Relationship to Other Modules

- **People** → defines who holds authority
- **Contribution** → produces actions subject to review
- **Audit** → provides evidence for enforcement
- **Value Flow** → may be paused during disputes

Accountability is the enforcement layer that binds all modules together.
