# TEOS Forge — Comprehensive Roadmap

This roadmap defines how TEOS Forge evolves from a governance standard into a globally adopted framework for **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**. 

TEOS Forge is Egyptian-originated, sovereign by design, and universally applicable. It operates on the principle that the social architecture of software (governance) must precede its technical execution.

## 🏛️ Principles

1. **Governance before automation** – Rules are human-readable before machine-executable.
2. **Audit before value** – No resource flow without a verified audit trail.
3. **Accountability before scale** – Systems must be defensible before expansion.
4. **Sovereign adoption** – No central dependency; institutions own their instance.
5. **Federated interoperability** – Cross-border collaboration by design.

## 📍 Phase 0 — Governance Foundation (Completed)

**Goal:** Establish explicit, documented governance before any automation.

* **Governance Constitution:** Define the rules of engagement.
* **Accountability Protocols:** Levels 1–4 escalation and dispute resolution.
* **Audit Readiness:** Strict repository hygiene and compliance checklists.
* **Value Flow Rules:** Conceptual frameworks for rewards and reputation.
* **CI Workflows:** Initial policy-as-code linting.

**Status:** ✅ Completed (v0.1.0)

## 📍 Phase 1 — GitHub App Coordination Layer (Active)

**Goal:** Automate enforcement of governance signals without transferring authority.

* **GitHub App Manifest:** Deployment configuration (`github-app/app.yml`).
* **Observation Layer:** Webhook endpoints with signature verification.
* **Audit Event Logging:** Automated generation of immutable audit entries.
* **Trust Signals:** Issuance of `contribution_verified` labels and non-monetary badges.
* **Health Monitoring:** Uptime and signature integrity checks.



**Phase 1 Completion Criteria:**
- App verifies all incoming webhook signatures.
- Audit events are generated for every merge to protected branches.
- No automated financial execution is enabled.

**Status:** 🏗️ In Progress
- Phase 1 explicitly excludes any on-chain or off-chain financial execution.

## 📍 Phase 2 — Treasury & Off-Chain Value Flow (Planned)

**Goal:** Enable treasury execution under governance and audit control.

* **Treasury Intent:** Frameworks for proposing resource allocation.
* **Dual Sign-off:** Mandatory concurrence between Maintainers and Auditors for payouts.
* **Off-Chain Logs:** Human-readable payout execution history.
* **Institutional Reporting:** Standardized templates for government and NGO audit compliance.

**Status:** 📅 Planned

---

## 📍 Phase 3 — On-Chain Execution (Controlled & Governed)

**Goal:** Extend value flow onto secure smart contracts without compromising governance.

* **Governed Payouts:** Contract execution of approved payout intents (Solana/Ethereum/Pi).
* **On-Chain Reputation:** Verifiable contribution records used for staking.
* **Emergency Pause:** A "Kill Switch" linked to Phase 0 accountability protocols.
* **Transparency Dashboards:** Read-only views of treasury health and audit traces.



**Status:** 📅 Planned

---

## 📍 Phase 4 — Global DPI Federation (Future)

**Goal:** Enable sovereign instances of TEOS Forge to interoperate and exchange audit data.

* **Federation Protocols:** Standardized communication between independent TEOS deployments.
* **Cross-Instance Audit:** Enabling one institution to verify the logs of another.
* **Inter-Institution Alignment:** Collaborative governance for regional infrastructure.
* **Global Standards Compliance:** Alignment with UN and World Bank DPI frameworks.

**Status:** 🚀 Future

---

## 📊 Metrics of Success

* **Institutional Adoption:** Successful pilot deployments in government or civic sectors.
* **Audit Integrity:** Zero undocumented merges or policy bypasses.
* **Sovereign Resilience:** Ability for a fork to operate independently of the original maintainers.
* **Federation Growth:** Multiple instances exchanging verified audit signals.
