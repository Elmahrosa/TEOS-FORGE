# TEOS Forge — Comprehensive Roadmap

This roadmap defines how TEOS Forge evolves from a governance standard
into a globally adopted framework for Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI).

TEOS Forge is Egyptian-originated, sovereign by design, and universally applicable.

---

## Principles

1. Governance before automation  
2. Audit before value  
3. Accountability before scale  
4. Sovereign adoption without constraint  
5. Federated interoperability across institutions

---

## Phase 0 — Governance Foundation (Completed)

**Goal:** Establish explicit, documented governance before any automation.

- Governance constitution  
- Accountability and escalation protocols  
- Audit readiness policies  
- Value Flow rules (off-chain, conceptual)  
- CI workflows and contribution templates

**Status:** Completed

---

## Phase 1 — GitHub App Coordination Layer (Active)

**Goal:** Automate enforcement of governance signals without transferring authority.

- GitHub App manifest (`github-app/app.yml`)
- Webhook endpoints with signature verification
- Audit event logging (Phase 1 backend)
- Contribution_verified signals on PR merges
- Non-monetary badge issuance  
- Health checks and uptime monitoring

**Output:** Verified, auditable contribution events  
**Status:** In progress

---

## Phase 2 — Treasury & Off-Chain Value Flow (Planned)

**Goal:** Enable treasury execution under governance and audit control.

- Treasury intent and approval frameworks
- Dual sign-off governance for payouts
- Off-chain payout execution logs
- Treasury report templates
- Institutional reporting formats

**Output:** Audit-gated value execution  
**Status:** Planned

---

## Phase 3 — On-Chain Execution (Controlled & Governed)

**Goal:** Extend value flow onto secure smart contracts without compromising governance.

- Contract execution of approved payout intents
- On-chain reputation and staking mechanisms
- Audit trace mirroring on chain
- Emergency pause functionality
- Read-only transparency dashboards

**Output:** On-chain DPI execution aligned with governance  
**Status:** Planned

---

## Phase 4 — Global DPI Federation (Future)

**Goal:** Enable sovereign instances of TEOS Forge to interoperate,
exchange audit data, and support federated infrastructure.

- Federation protocols
- Cross-instance audit compatibility
- Inter-institution governance alignment
- Optional international standards compliance layers

**Output:** Sovereign, interoperable DPI landscapes  
**Status:** Future

---

## Metrics of Success

- Institutional pilot deployments  
- Audit certification (formal review bodies)  
- Federation use cases in multiple jurisdictions  
- Reference governance adoption in DPI frameworks
