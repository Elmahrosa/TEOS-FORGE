# TEOS Forge — Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the **phased rollout** of TEOS Forge as
**governable, auditable civic infrastructure**.

Each phase builds on the previous one.
No phase is skipped.
No automation precedes governance.

---
> TEOS Forge is Egypt‑originated but globally applicable.  
> Each phase prepares for **international institutional adoption**.


## Guiding Principle

> **Governance before automation.  
> Audit before value.  
> Accountability before scale.**

This roadmap reflects institutional deployment standards,
not startup speed-chasing.

## Phase 0 — Governance Foundation (COMPLETED)

**Objective:** Establish trust, rules, and authority before execution.

### Scope
- Governance constitution (`docs/governance.md`)
- Sustainability model (`docs/monetization.md`)
- Accountability framework
- Audit framework
- Value-flow rules (off-chain)
- Contributor identity & role definitions
- PR and Issue enforcement templates
- CI governance checks

### Deliverables
- Governable repository structure
- Explicit roles and separation of powers
- Escalation and dispute resolution
- Audit readiness checklist
- Value-flow rules without execution

### Status
**Completed**  
All modules defined and reviewable.

## Phase 1 — GitHub App Coordination Layer

**Objective:** Automate enforcement while preserving human authority.

### Scope
- GitHub App (TEOS Forge App)
- Event listeners:
  - Pull requests
  - Issues and proposals
  - Reviews and approvals
- Automated status checks:
  - Contribution verification
  - Governance compliance
  - Audit gating
- Badge issuance (non-monetary)
- Audit log triggers

### Controls
- Human approvals remain mandatory
- App cannot merge code
- App cannot move treasury value
- App enforces visibility and traceability only

### Deliverables
- GitHub App manifest
- Permission-scoped automation
- Audit-linked event logging
- Contribution and governance signals

### Status
**Planned**

## Phase 2 — Treasury & Value Flow Execution (Off-Chain)

**Objective:** Execute rewards and payouts under strict governance.

### Scope
- Treasury management (off-chain)

- Institutional reporting formats

### Controls
- No automatic payouts
- Maintainer + Auditor approval required
- Audit clearance required
- Full payout traceability

### Deliverables
- Treasury reports
- Payout intent templates
- Governance-linked disbursement logs
- Institutional audit summaries

### Status
**Planned**

## Phase 3 — On-Chain Value Flow (Controlled)

**Objective:** Move value execution on-chain without sacrificing control.

### Scope
- Smart contracts reflecting governance rules
- On-chain payout execution
- On-chain staking and reputation
- Slashing mechanisms (governance-triggered)
- Read-only transparency dashboards

### Controls
- Smart contracts mirror off-chain rules
- No autonomous governance
- On-chain execution gated by off-chain decisions
- Emergency pause mechanisms

### Deliverables
- Governance-aligned smart contracts
- On-chain treasury execution
- Verifiable staking and slashing
- Public audit dashboards

### Status
**Planned**

---

## Phase 4 — Institutional Deployment & Federation

**Objective:** Enable sovereign and institutional instances.

### Scope
- White-label deployments
- Institutional governance overlays
- National or organizational forges
- Federation between instances
- Cross-instance audit compatibility

### Controls
- Local governance preserved
- Interoperability without centralization
- Audit compatibility across deployments

### Deliverables
- Institutional deployment guides
- Federation protocols
- Compliance mapping (GovTech / DPI)
- Long-term maintenance framework

### Status
**Future**

## Roadmap Summary

| Phase | Focus | Automation | Value Execution |
|-----|------|------------|----------------|
| Phase 0 | Governance | None | None |
| Phase 1 | GitHub App | Limited | None |
| Phase 2 | Treasury | Limited | Off-chain |
| Phase 3 | On-chain | Controlled | On-chain |
| Phase 4 | Federation | Configurable | Multi-instance |

---

## Final Note

TEOS Forge is designed to be **slow where trust matters** and
**fast only where rules already exist**.

This roadmap prioritizes:
- Institutional trust
- Civic legitimacy
- Long-term sustainability

Over short-term velocity.
