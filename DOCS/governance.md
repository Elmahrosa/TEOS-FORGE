## Sovereign & Universal Governance

TEOS Forge governance is **anchored in Egypt** but designed for **global institutions**.  
Every module is portable, auditable, and federated — ensuring compatibility across ministries, MDBs, and sovereign digital infrastructures.

TEOS Forge is an Egyptian-originated, globally applicable standard for governing digital public infrastructure development.

It is designed to be adopted by any country, institution, or public system while preserving local sovereignty, legal autonomy, and governance independence.
## Origin Stewardship

TEOS Forge originated under the leadership of
**Elmahrosa International** as part of the **TEOS Egypt** initiative.

Elmahrosa International acts as the **originating steward** of the framework,
responsible for maintaining the reference governance model
and canonical documentation.

This stewardship role does not limit the sovereignty,
legal authority, or autonomy of adopting institutions.
