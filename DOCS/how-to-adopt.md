# How to Adopt TEOS Forge  
## A Practical Guide for Ministries & Public Institutions

---

## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This document explains how a ministry or public institution can adopt **TEOS Forge**
as a governance framework for **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**.

TEOS Forge provides governance, auditability, and accountability for public
software development. It does **not** mandate specific technologies, vendors,
or financial systems.

---

## 2. What Adopting TEOS Forge Means

Adopting TEOS Forge means that an institution:

- Establishes explicit governance rules for public software
- Defines roles, authority, and escalation paths
- Ensures audit readiness from day one
- Separates decision-making from technical execution
- Retains full sovereignty and exit rights

Adoption does **not** mean:

- Transferring control to external entities
- Using blockchain or tokens by default
- Lock-in to any vendor or platform

---

## 3. Suitable Use Cases

TEOS Forge is suitable for:

- National digital platforms
- Public registries and identity systems
- Inter-agency software foundations
- GovTech or civic-tech initiatives
- Long-lived digital infrastructure programs

It is especially appropriate where:

- Multiple stakeholders contribute
- Accountability must be explicit
- Systems must outlive individual teams or funding cycles

---

## 4. Adoption Models

Institutions may adopt TEOS Forge in one of three ways:

### Model A — Reference Governance
- Use TEOS Forge documentation as a governance reference
- Adapt rules to local policy and law
- No automation required

### Model B — Repository Governance
- Apply TEOS Forge structure to GitHub or GitLab repositories
- Enforce contribution, audit, and escalation rules
- Use CI to validate governance hygiene

### Model C — Coordinated Governance + Automation
- Deploy the optional GitHub App layer
- Automate audit signals and contribution verification
- Maintain human authority over all decisions

Institutions may start with Model A and progress gradually.

## 5. Step-by-Step Adoption Process

### Step 1 — Governance Review
- Review `docs/governance.md`
- Align roles and escalation with national regulations
- Identify equivalents to:
  - Maintainer
  - Steward
  - Auditor

### Step 2 — Repository Setup
- Create or select a public or private repository
- Add required civic files:
  - LICENSE
  - SECURITY.md
  - Governance documents
- Apply the TEOS Forge folder structure

### Step 3 — Role Assignment
- Assign governance roles formally
- Document authority boundaries
- Ensure separation of powers

### Step 4 — Audit Readiness Check
- Apply the audit checklist (`audit/compliance.md`)
- Confirm no undocumented decision paths exist
- Ensure audit logs are immutable

### Step 5 — Optional Automation
- Deploy the GitHub App (Phase 1)
- Enable webhook-based audit logging
- Keep financial execution disabled unless explicitly approved

## 6. Legal & Sovereignty Considerations

TEOS Forge is designed to be:

- Jurisdiction-agnostic
- Policy-adaptable
- Exit-safe

Adopting institutions retain full authority over:

- Legal compliance
- Data residency
- Funding and treasury
- Governance modifications

No external approval is required to fork or modify the framework.

---

## 7. Audit & Oversight

TEOS Forge supports:

- Internal audits
- Supreme audit institutions
- Parliamentary oversight
- External review bodies

Audit evidence includes:

- Immutable audit logs
- Documented governance decisions
- Verified contribution trails
- Clear accountability mapping

---

## 8. Financial Systems (Optional)

Financial execution is **not required**.

If enabled, TEOS Forge supports:

- Off-chain treasury governance
- Dual or multi-signatory approval
- Full audit traceability

On-chain execution is a future, optional phase subject to policy approval.

---

## 9. Exit & Continuity Guarantees

At any time, an institution may:

- Fork repositories
- Disable automation
- Replace governance actors
- Continue operations independently

All records remain accessible and verifiable.

---

## 10. Origin & Stewardship

TEOS Forge originated in Egypt and is stewarded by  
**Elmahrosa International — TEOS Egypt**.

Stewardship provides:

- Reference governance
- Documentation continuity
- Architectural integrity

It does not confer control over adopting institutions.

---

## 11. Summary

TEOS Forge enables ministries to build Digital Public Infrastructure with:

- Trust without centralization
- Governance without rigidity
- Auditability without friction
- Sovereignty without isolation

It is designed for decades-long public value, not short-term delivery.

---

### Recommended Next Step for Ministries

Conduct a **Phase 0 Governance Review** using TEOS Forge
before initiating or scaling any DPI project.
