# TEOS Forge
# TEOS Forge — Global Governance Engine

Originated in Egypt under Elmahrosa International, TEOS Forge is a **sovereign, universal framework** for Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI).  
It transforms repositories into **governable, auditable civic systems** — applicable to ministries, banks, NGOs, and global institutions.

## Mission
Governance before automation.  
Audit before value.  
Accountability before scale.

## Scope
- Universal governance modules (People, Contribution, Accountability, Audit, Value Flow)
- Institutional trust signals (badges, CI, audit logs)
- Treasury and payout frameworks (off‑chain and on‑chain)
- Federation protocols for multi‑country adoption

**Sovereign Developer Coordination & Contribution Platform**  
Built on GitHub, Powered by TEOS

## What Is TEOS Forge?

TEOS Forge transforms GitHub repositories into **governable, auditable, and value-aware coordination systems**.

It is **not** a framework.  
It is **not** a DAO experiment.  

It is **civic-grade developer infrastructure** designed for long-term public and institutional use.

TEOS Forge enables:

- Verified, attributable contribution  
- Enforced governance and role clarity  
- Transparent, reviewable audit trails  
- Accountable value flow and treasury discipline  
- Institutional trust without centralization  

---

## Core Pillars

| Pillar | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| **People** | Contributor identity, roles, verification, and badges |
| **Contribution** | Commits, pull requests, proposals, and bounties |
| **Accountability** | Permissions, escalation, and dispute resolution |
| **Audit** | Compliance, logs, hygiene, and audit readiness |
| **Value Flow** | Rewards, treasury governance, staking, royalties |

Each pillar is enforced through documentation, CI, governance rules, and review — not promises.

## Governance

TEOS Forge is governed by an explicit constitution.

- Roles, permissions, and escalation paths are defined in advance  
- Governance changes require documented proposals and review  
- Audit findings override convenience and speed  

📜 See: [`docs/governance.md`](docs/governance.md)

---

## Sustainability

TEOS Forge is **open by default** and **sustainable by design**.

- Core coordination logic is open-source  
- Contributions are never paywalled  
- Monetization applies only to:
  - Hosted infrastructure
  - Enterprise compliance & support
  - White-label sovereign deployments  

💠 See: [`docs/monetization.md`](docs/monetization.md)

## Trust Signals

Badges in this repository are **governance signals**, not marketing.

They reflect verifiable states enforced by policy, automation, and review.

## Who This Is For

TEOS Forge is designed for:
