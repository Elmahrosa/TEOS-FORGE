## Constitutional Authority (Read First)

All governance legitimacy derives from the **International Civic Blockchain Constitution**.

## Governance Doctrine

**Born in Egypt for the World**  
*Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World.*

Elmahrosa establishes governance first.

human, institutional, or sovereign governance.
