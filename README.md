## Vision

Founded in Egypt under **Ayman Seif** and **Elmahrosa International**, TEOS Forge is the **first civic‑first governance engine** designed for **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**.  
It is **Egypt‑originated but globally sovereign and universal**, providing a framework for ministries, banks, NGOs, and institutions worldwide.

See full vision: [`docs/vision.md`](docs/vision.md)

---

## Mission

> **Governance before automation.  
> Audit before value.  
> Accountability before scale.**

TEOS Forge transforms repositories into **governable civic systems**.  
Every commit, issue, and payout is subject to transparent governance, audit readiness, and institutional trust signals.

---

## Scope

- Universal governance modules (People, Contribution, Accountability, Audit, Value Flow)  
- Institutional trust signals (badges, CI, audit logs)  
- Treasury and payout frameworks (off‑chain and on‑chain)  
- Federation protocols for multi‑country adoption  

**Sovereign Developer Coordination & Contribution Platform**  
Built on GitHub, Powered by TEOS  

> Turning Repositories into Civic Infrastructure

---

## Who TEOS Forge Is For

- Governments and public institutions  
- National and cross‑border Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)  
- Civic‑tech and public software foundations  
- Long‑lived protocol and infrastructure builders  
- Institutions requiring auditability, sovereignty, and exit guarantees  

It is **originated in Egypt**, but **not limited to any jurisdiction**.  

TEOS Forge is intentionally:
- Jurisdiction‑agnostic  
- Vendor‑neutral  
- Sovereignty‑preserving  
- Compatible with national legal frameworks  

It is not optimized for speculative ecosystems or informal governance.

## What Is TEOS Forge?

TEOS Forge transforms GitHub repositories into **governable, auditable, and value‑aware coordination systems**.  

It is **not** a framework.  
It is **not** a DAO experiment.  

It is **civic‑grade developer infrastructure** designed for long‑term public and institutional use.

TEOS Forge enables:
- Verified, attributable contribution  
- Enforced governance and role clarity  
- Transparent, reviewable audit trails  
- Accountable value flow and treasury discipline  
- Institutional trust without centralization  

---

## Core Pillars

| Pillar | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **People** | Contributor identity, roles, verification, and badges |
| **Contribution** | Commits, pull requests, proposals, and bounties |
| **Accountability** | Permissions, escalation, and dispute resolution |
| **Audit** | Compliance, logs, hygiene, and audit readiness |
| **Value Flow** | Rewards, treasury governance, staking, royalties |

Each pillar is enforced through documentation, CI, governance rules, and review — not promises.
