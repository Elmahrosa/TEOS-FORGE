# 🏛 TEOS Forge

**Governance before automation.  
Audit before value.  
Accountability before scale.**

Originated and stewarded by **Elmahrosa International — TEOS Egypt**

---

## 📌 Overview

**TEOS Forge** is the governance backbone of the **Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack**.

It defines how civic, institutional, and sovereign digital systems are **designed, governed, audited, and scaled** *before* automation or value transfer.

TEOS Forge is not a document archive.  
It is a **living governance engine** and a **state-grade development factory** for **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**.

---

## 🛠️ Developer Toolkit (Forge Layer)

TEOS Forge is governance **and** production.

The `forge/` layer provides tools, templates, and SDKs for building governed applications that may claim **TEOS legitimacy only after governance validation**.

### CLI Commands (MVP)

```bash
teos init my-dpi-project
teos add template pi-marketplace
teos validate
teos deploy testnet
teos audit --export pdf
```

> ⚠️ Projects that fail `teos validate` **cannot claim TEOS legitimacy**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```text
TEOS-FORGE/
├── governance/      # Constitutional rules (immutable)
├── forge/           # CLI, templates, contracts, SDK
├── integration/     # Bridges to Pi, banking, government
├── deployment/      # Local, testnet, mainnet environments
└── docs/            # Governance + institutional documentation
```

Governance is the **spine**.  
Forge is the **muscle**.  
Outputs are **sovereign digital institutions**.

## 🧩 Templates (Institutional Blueprints)

TEOS Forge provides **institutional templates**, not hackathon starters.  
Each template includes governance configuration, audit rules, and compliance flags.

* 🪪 Digital Identity Registry  
* 💸 Subsidy / Aid Distribution System  
* 🛒 Public Marketplace  
* 📑 Cooperative Treasury  
* 💳 Pi-based Payments Application

## 📊 Compliance Dashboard

TEOS Forge maintains a governance alignment dashboard to ensure **continuous enforcement** across the stack.

A live `governance-status.md` file tracks compliance alignment across integrated repositories.

| Repository | Status                |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| TEOS-FORGE | ✅ Aligned             |
| Bankchain  | ✅ Aligned             |
| Demo Repo  | ⚠️ Missing Governance |

This dashboard is designed to be updated via **GitHub Actions** on a fixed schedule.

## 📈 Success Metrics

TEOS Forge measures success through **institutional outcomes**:

* Number of governed applications deployed  
* Number of audit-ready outputs produced  
* Institutional pilots launched  
* Governments / NGOs referencing TEOS documentation  
* Forks that **retain governance rules** without dilution  

---

## ⚠️ Strategic Positioning

TEOS Forge is a **state-grade software factory** with optional blockchain rails.  
It is designed to produce **auditable, sovereign, long-lived digital institutions**, not speculative consumer applications.
