# 🏛️ TEOS-FORGE | ELMAHROSA

**Sovereign Governance Stewardship & Lifecycle Authority**

The supreme governance anchor of the TEOS / Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack. This repository defines stewardship, lifecycle rules, release governance, accountability protocols, and exit guarantees for sovereign Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) development.

---

## 🏛️ Constitutional Authority

This repository derives its authority from the **International Civic Blockchain Constitution (ICBC)**.

> **https://github.com/Elmahrosa/International-Civic-Blockchain-Constitution**

Any implementation or use of this governance framework must comply fully with the ICBC and TESL. TEOS-FORGE operationalizes the Constitution into enforceable governance artifacts.
This authority is binding across all jurisdictions and supersedes any conflicting technical, community, or automated governance claims.

---

## 📍 Repository Standing

This repository is the **supreme governance anchor** for the entire ecosystem.

It defines how governance is authored, versioned, enforced, and evolved across all TEOS systems and deployments. It ensures that **Code is Law**, but that Law is written, reviewed, and ratified by sovereign human authority.

**Founder & Owner:** Elmahrosa International — TEOS Egypt  
**Founder Authority:** Ayman Seif

## 🌍 Governance Doctrine

**Born in Egypt for the World**  
*Built in Egypt. Engineered for Nations. Scaled for the World.*

Elmahrosa establishes **governance first**. Institutions enforce policy. Technology executes under authority.

**The Hierarchy of Authority:**
1.  **National Law & Sovereign Will** (Supreme)
2.  **International Civic Blockchain Constitution**
3.  **Human Institutional Stewardship**
4.  **Protocol & Smart Contracts**
5.  **Artificial Intelligence** (Decision Support Only)

> **Non-Negotiable:** No protocol, DAO, AI, or blockchain mechanism may supersede human, institutional, or sovereign governance.

## ⚙️ The Forge vs. The Core

To understand the architecture, one must distinguish between Governance and Execution:

| Component | Repository | Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Forge** | **[TEOS-FORGE](https://github.com/Elmahrosa/TEOS-FORGE)** | **Governance.** Defines *what* must be built, *how* it is governed, and *who* is accountable. It is the rulebook. |
| **The Kernel** | **[elmahrosa-core](https://github.com/Elmahrosa/elmahrosa-core)** | **Execution.** Contains the runtime code, registries, and technical implementation required to run the ecosystem. |

**TEOS-FORGE is not an application and not a DAO.** It is a sovereign governance control layer designed for nations and institutions. It validates the output of the Core.

---

## 🎯 Mission

The mission of **TEOS-FORGE** is to ensure that governance remains authoritative, coherent, and enforceable across the entire TEOS ecosystem.

It guarantees that:
*   **Governance precedes automation.**
*   **Human authority precedes AI.**
*   **National law precedes protocol rules.**
*   **Accountability precedes scale.**
*   All technical systems remain constitutionally bound.

## 📜 Scope of Authority

| Domain | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Constitution** | Stewardship, interpretation, and enforcement of the ICBC. |
| **Lifecycle** | Management of the Draft → Review → Ratify → Enforce pipeline. |
| **Version Control** | Policy evolution, deprecation, and backward compatibility checks. |
| **Compliance** | Verification of alignment across all dependent repositories. |
| **Certification** | Readiness checks for Institutional and National deployment. |
| **Arbitration** | Final authority on governance conflicts, forks, and overrides. |

## ⚔️ Core Principles

1.  **Constitution before Code**
2.  **Governance before Automation**
3.  **Human Authority before AI**
4.  **Sovereignty before Decentralization**
5.  **Accountability before Scale**

---

*   **Mandatory Reference:** All projects must reference TEOS-FORGE as their governance anchor.
*   **Compliance:** All systems must comply with ratified governance artifacts.
*   **Sanctions:** Projects are subject to review, suspension, or revocation of access if found non-compliant.
