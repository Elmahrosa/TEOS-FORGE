# 🏛 TEOS Forge

**Governance before automation.  
Audit before value.  
Accountability before scale.**

Originated and stewarded by **Elmahrosa International — TEOS Egypt**

---

## 📌 Overview

**TEOS Forge** is the governance and policy backbone of the **Elmahrosa Sovereign Stack**.  
It defines how civic, institutional, and sovereign digital systems are **designed, governed, audited, and scaled** before automation or value transfer occurs.

TEOS Forge is not merely a document set.  
It is a **living governance engine** and an institutional-grade production factory for **Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)**.

---

## 🛠️ Developer Toolkit (Forge Layer)

TEOS Forge is not only governance — it is also a **production factory**.

The `forge/` layer provides tools, templates, and SDK primitives for building governed applications that can claim TEOS legitimacy only when they pass governance enforcement.

### CLI Commands (MVP)

```bash
teos init my-dpi-project          # Create a new governed project
teos add template pi-marketplace  # Add an institutional template
teos validate                     # Verify governance + compliance
teos deploy testnet               # Deploy to TEOS testnet
teos audit --export pdf           # Export audit bundle
````

> ⚠️ Projects that fail `teos validate` **cannot claim TEOS legitimacy**.

Governance is the **spine**.
Forge is the **muscle**.

## 🧩 Templates (Institutional Blueprints)

TEOS Forge provides **institutional templates**, not hackathon starters.
Each template includes governance configuration, audit rules, and compliance flags.

* 🪪 Digital Identity Registry
* 💸 Subsidy / Aid Distribution System
* 🛒 Public Marketplace
* 📑 Cooperative Treasury
* 💳 Pi-based Payments Application

## 📊 Compliance Dashboard

TEOS Forge maintains a governance alignment dashboard to ensure continuous enforcement across the stack.

A live `governance-status.md` file tracks compliance alignment across all integrated repositories.

| Repository | Status                |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| TEOS-FORGE | ✅ Aligned             |
| Bankchain  | ✅ Aligned             |
| Demo Repo  | ⚠️ Missing Governance |

This dashboard is designed to be updated via GitHub Actions on a fixed schedule, proving **continuous governance enforcement**.

## ⚠️ Strategic Positioning

TEOS Forge is a **state-grade software factory** with optional blockchain rails.
